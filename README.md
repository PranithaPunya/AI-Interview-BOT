# AI-Interview-BOT

This repository contains a minimal Django project skeleton for the AI Interview BOT.

Quick start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run migrations and start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to see the landing page.

Next steps

- Add apps, models, APIs, and frontend views as needed.
- If you want, I can add a Dockerfile, tests, or CI next.
